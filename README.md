# TheDecisionGame

To show case my Python skills and leaving the famous Tutorial-loop i started two projects. 
One of them is aspired from the game "Detroit 3000" (you should definetly check it out).
I wanted to implement the same type of game where the decision you take in the game decide about the outcome of it.
The programming style that i want to use (27.12.2022) is a textadventure.
I will keep up you updated in my documentation when i'm coding.
